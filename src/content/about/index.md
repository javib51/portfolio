Hello! I'm Javier, a software engineer based in Stockholm, Sweden who enjoys be challenged and solve problems in different ways (System Design, CD/CI, testing and backend development). Lately, I have been focus on my studies at [EIT Digital Master School](https://masterschool.eitdigital.eu/) ([Aalto University](https://aalto.fi/) and [KTH University](https://kth.se/)) where I keep developing my Cloud Architecture design skills meanwhile I learn the basics of Entrepeneurship. [Kaizen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaizen) is a key personal foundation that I apply to my personal and profesional life.

Shortly after graduating from [Technical University of Madrid](http://www.upm.es/internacional), I joined the engineering team at [Vipera](http://www.vipera.com/) where I worked on a wide variety of interesting and challenging projects on a daily basis. Nowdays, I spend my time finishing my master degree in _Cloud Computing and Entrepeneurship_ and developing a peer to peer online rental marketplace [Trukatu](https://trukatu.io).

Here are some of my tech skills:
